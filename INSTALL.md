Installation instructions are a critical part of your project's documentation, guiding users through setting up your software on their systems. Typically, these instructions are included in your project's `README.md` file, which is the first document users see when visiting your repository on GitHub. This placement ensures that the information is easily accessible and helps users quickly get started with your project.

For projects with more complex setup processes or those requiring detailed configuration steps, you might also consider creating a dedicated `INSTALL.md` file or a `/docs` directory containing more comprehensive installation guides. If you choose to go this route, make sure to link to these files from your `README.md` to direct users accordingly.

Hereâ€™s a template for including installation instructions in your `README.md` file for the Shiva project:

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the Shiva project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

Optionally, you might list any other dependencies or prerequisites needed for your project.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning the Shiva project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shiva.git
   ```

   Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username or organization name where the repository is hosted.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd shiva
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**

   Install all the necessary Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all the libraries listed there.

### Configuration (Optional)

If your project requires additional configuration (such as setting environment variables, configuring external services, etc.), provide those steps here.

### Running the Project

Finally, instruct users on how to run the project:

```bash
python shiva_run.py
```

Replace `shiva_run.py` with the actual script name to start your project.
