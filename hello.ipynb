# Instructions for creating a Jupyter notebook:
# 1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed (you can install it via pip if needed)
# 2. Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal to start the Jupyter Notebook app.
# 3. Create a new notebook by clicking on the "New" button and selecting "Python 3".
# 4. Copy the Python code provided above into a new cell in the notebook.
# 5. Run the cell to see the output.

# Remember, to run actual GPT-3.5 examples, you'll need to install the `openai` library
# and have a valid OpenAI API key.
