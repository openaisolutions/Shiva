# This is a simple Jupyter Notebook to get started with GPT-3.5

# Import necessary libraries
import openai

# Set your OpenAI API key (ensure you have the openai library installed)
# openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

# Since we're starting without an API key and focusing on a "Hello World" concept,
# let's print "Hello World" to demonstrate the notebook's functionality.

print("Hello World")

# To proceed with GPT-3.5, you would typically use the `openai.Completion.create()` function
# with appropriate parameters. For now, we're focusing on the basics.
