Developing 'Shiva: An Aligned Mind,' a project focused on integrating hemispheric specialization into GPT architectures to refine AI responses. Prioritizing Python with OpenAI API (openai>=0.10.2) and Hugging Face's transformers>=4.5.0. Avoid heavy frameworks not directly related to AI or data processing. Adhere to PEP 8 standards for clean and readable code. Aim to enhance learning about AI model integration and application development, with well-documented code for educational purposes. Currently exploring retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. Need assistance in setting up a basic RAG example with concise explanations
